A simple **console-based task management application**, built with Python and designed to demonstrate **Clean Code**, **layered architecture**, and **good software design practices**.

This project is well-suited for **educational purposes**, small experiments, and as a reference for structuring CLI applications in Python.

---

## 📌 Project Idea

The goal of this project is to provide a lightweight task manager that runs entirely in the **terminal**, without external dependencies.

Each task contains:
- **Description**
- **Status**: `OPEN` or `CLOSED`
- **Due date**

All tasks are persisted in a **JSON file**, ensuring data is preserved between executions.

This project focuses on:
- Code readability
- Separation of concerns
- Maintainability
- Simplicity

---

## 🧱 Architecture

The application follows a **layered architecture**, inspired by common Python conventions.

### 📦 Domain Layer
Defines the `Task` entity and its behavior, independent of storage or user interface.

### ⚙️ Service Layer
Contains application use cases such as creating, editing, completing, and deleting tasks.

### 💾 Repository Layer
Handles persistence, converting tasks to and from JSON format.

### 🖥️ UI Layer
Manages user interaction via terminal menus and input.

---

## 🧭 Features

The console menu provides the following options:

0 - Exit
1 - List tasks
2 - Edit task
3 - Delete task
4 - Add new task
5 - Complete task

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ Requirements
- Python **3.10+**

### 2️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd task_manager
```

### 3️⃣ Run the application
```bash
python main.py
```

💾 Data Persistence

Tasks are stored in the following file: data/tasks.json

The file is automatically created on the first run if it does not exist.

🧼 Clean Code Principles

This project applies several Clean Code and design principles:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Clear and meaningful naming

Low coupling between layers

High cohesion

Domain isolated from infrastructure

Simple and readable code

🚀 Future Improvements

Possible enhancements include:

Unit tests

Replace JSON with SQLite

REST API using FastAPI

Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) architecture

Web or GUI interface
